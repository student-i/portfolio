        What is meal prep. It is the act of prepping your food ahead of time in order to 
        cut down on later prep time. It also allows you to take pre-prepared food on the 
        go. It helps you to improve your eating habits because it helps to cut down on the
         amount of times a person eats out in a week. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Being successful can be hard because it can seem like a daunting task to get started

          tired of eating the same thing again and again. We have a set of comprehensive 
          recipes for which ever part of your meal prepping and cooking journey you are at.

      <h3>How to get started</h3>
      <p>
        Getting started with lifestyle choices can be a daunting task. For every big change you want to make the best way to start is to in small and manageable feeling chunks. Working hard and going from 0 to 100 in the matter of a shopping trip is the type of thing that gets you burnt out quickly, especially if you are not used to cooking very often. The best way to start small is to do a couple meals a week and slowly build yourself up to cooking often.
      </p> 
      <p>
      In order to get started you need 2 things. The first being containers. You do not need anything fancy. You do not need anything expensive. You just need something usable if you want to upgrade later then you can. The other thing you need is a plan. What you are going to make that week and what you want to buy and do in order to do that.
