                        For every big change you want to make the best way to start is to in small and manageable feeling chunks. Working hard and going from 0 to 100 in the matter of a shopping trip is the type of thing that gets you burnt out quickly, especially if you are not used to cooking very often. The best way to start small is to do a couple meals a week and slowly build yourself up to cooking often. You don’t have to start with making every single meal you cook from scratch. The only wrong way to go about starting to meal prep is making food you don’t enjoy. Meal prep is not eating salad every day it is not eating very little food either. It is changing the way you eat and the best way to do that is a little bit at a time.

                        In order to get started you need 2 things. The first being containers. You do not need anything fancy. You do not need anything expensive. You just need something usable if you want to upgrade later then you can. Some people are going to want something nice to start of with but there are so many option out there and all you need is something that will work well for you. The other thing you need is a plan. What you are going to make that week and what you want to buy and do in order to do that. Trying to start without any sort of plan will have giving up before you get anywhere. Start with a couple of meals and something you have been wanting to try making. Remember your first goal is not to have something that people would call perfect meal prepping. Your first goal is to not overwhelm yourself.
